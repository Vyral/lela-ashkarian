Today I’m talking about the upcoming mini lobster season. I'm sure most of you know what mini lobster season is or you have come down to the Keys to enjoy it. The season is always on the last Wednesday and Thursday of July. It occurs before the commercial lobstermen are allowed to set their traps. You can visit the&nbsp;<u><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.eregulations.com/florida/fishing/saltwater/crustaceans-mollusks/">FWC&rsquo;s website</a></u> for the exact rules and regulations, but here are a few important reminders:

**1\. Make sure you have your fishing license** with an added lobster permit.

**2\. Your daily bag limit**. This is going to be six per person in Monroe county.

**3\. Minimum size**. You need to measure the lobsters in the water. The carapace must be larger than three inches.

**4\. Night diving** is prohibited in Monroe county.

**5\. Stay away from prohibited areas**. These include John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park and the Everglades National Park.

It's a great time to harvest some lobsters for dinner. Stay proactive and be safe. If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to us.
