What’s the latest news from our Florida Keys real estate market?

Our industry continues to operate one day at a time the best it can, and **we’ve had to make some changes to adapt to the times.** We agents are taking the necessary precautions to keep us and our customers safe.&nbsp;

The Keys are still closed to any visitors for the time being. The roadblocks are up, and airport restrictions are tightening. We’re not sure when it will be reopened, but at the moment, only residents, property owners, leasees, or those who have a work permit in Monroe County are allowed.

As we work from home, we’re still a resource to you, and we’ve been lining up virtual meetings with our customers to answer any questions they have and determine the right marketing plan for those who still need to buy or sell.&nbsp;

As far as the market itself goes, 13 listings went live the day this video was recorded. Additionally, five properties went under contract, 10 closed, seven went into “pending” status (i.e., all the contingencies have been met), and there were 11 price reductions.&nbsp;

We’re still able to do business, and we haven’t had any issues with closings thus far. **We’re able to do this by utilizing virtual showings, open houses, and video tours.**&nbsp;
