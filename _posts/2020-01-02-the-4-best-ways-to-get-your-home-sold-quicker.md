Here are the top four factors that move the needle and help you get your home sold quicker:

**1\. Price.** If a home isn’t priced correctly, buyers will dismiss and ignore it.

**2\. Location.** Down here in the Keys, location is key. Whether or not you’re on the waterfront, have a dock, or the neighborhood allows vacation rentals are all important factors.
