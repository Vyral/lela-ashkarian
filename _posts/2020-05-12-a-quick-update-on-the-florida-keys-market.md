I hope all is well with you and your family as we continue to navigate what’s going on in the world. We’re taking things day by day, but we wanted to give you an update on what’s been happening here in the Keys as of late.

As of last Monday, most non-essential businesses here in the Keys were allowed to reopen at a 25% capacity. This means that restaurants, retail stores, and more are opening back up.

As for our real estate market, things are going very well. We’re a big second home market so we’re used to coordinating virtual showings, but we’ve been implementing Facetime and Zoom into our business as well. **This technology has allowed us to have at least one home go under contract every week since the beginning of April.** Showing properties with masks on is a little strange, but we’re taking every necessary precaution to help protect our clients.

The stats that just came out showed us that home sales were up by 3.2% in the first quarter of this year as our listings dropped by nearly 10%. Our days on market remained pretty flat, from 124 to 120. As of May 7, we have seen 17 listings come on the market, seven homes go under contract, and three home sales close in just one day.

**We’re still here, working, and happy to support you and your real estate goals.** If you'd like to schedule a meeting or showing or if you have any questions for us, don't hesitate to reach out via phone or email today. We look forward to hearing from you.
