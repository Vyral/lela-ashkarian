I want to let you know about the fun lifestyle that we enjoy here in the Florida Keys that you can enjoy as a visitor or a resident. Summertime is always busy since a lot of people vacation here. In the Keys, we don't just sell properties to people, we also sell a water-loving lifestyle. Thereâ€™s fishing, diving, kiteboarding, you name it, and it can be done here.

**We have a lot of dolphin fishing coming up this summer** which is always very fun. There are a couple of tournaments that happen every year. We were fortunate enough to fish in the Habitat for Humanity Mother's Day Tournament. It was a great time, and you can see some of the pictures and videos from that day in the video above. I ended up getting second-place lady angler, and our daughter got second-place junior angler.

It's a great time to get out whether you have a boat or charter one. Dolphin fishing is lots of fun, and **there are several tournaments coming up in June** everywhere from Key Largo down to Key West. Watersports are a part of the lifestyle down here, so if you're coming down, check out one of those tournaments.
