Before this year, permits for new buildings in Monroe County were set to expire by 2023, as mandated by the state. This February, however, change in the ROGO process or Unincorporated Monroe County adopts an ordinance for new building permits. That doesn’t mean we’re getting more building permits; it just means they’re going to allocate less per quarter than they have in the past.

Over four allocations periods in unincorporated Monroe County, they would previously allocate about 126 permits, which were divided between the upper and lower Keys, as well as Big Pine Key and No Name Key. For example, each year, Big Pine and No Name Keys got eight permits. **Under this new ordinance, that number will be cut down to four, or one every allocation period.**

**The cuts for these permits began on July 13, 2020,** and we are currently in that first allocation period, which should come out in October.

This is going to be interesting to watch as it plays out. If you have any questions with regard to the ROGO (Rate of Growth Ordinance) process and new construction building here in the Keys, please feel free to reach out to us. We have all the resources you need to help guide you.
