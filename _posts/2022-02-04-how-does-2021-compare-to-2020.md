Now that we have all the numbers for 2021, we thought it would be a good idea to look back on that crazy year of real estate. We already know that 2020 was one of the hottest years on record, so did 2021 continue the trend?

For this update, we’ll be discussing the Keys market, so from Key Largo to Key West. We’ll also be comparing the numbers from 2021 to 2020.&nbsp;

**Total sales** in 2021 were 4,325, which was a 31% increase from 2020.&nbsp;

**The average sales price** was $877,000, which was a 30% increase from 2020.&nbsp;

**The total dollar volume** of our market was just shy of $3.8 billion, which is over a 70% increase from 2020.&nbsp;

**Our average days on market** decreased to 85 days; in 2020, it was 120 days. Since we’re a big market for second homes, this is a very low number.&nbsp;

**The average list price** was about $1.4 million, which is a 29% increase from 2020.&nbsp;

At the end of December, there were **337 pending transactions.** This is a little lower than what we saw in 2020, but our season was pushed back more that year.&nbsp;

As for 2022, we expect to see a rise in inventory over the winter months since this is our busiest time of year. Everyone is planning vacations to the Keys, and while they’re here, many people like to look at homes.&nbsp;
