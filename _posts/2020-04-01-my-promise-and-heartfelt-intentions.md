My Promise and heartfelt intentions: We can't go around it, over it, but we can go thru it.

You need not be shaken, devastated - though you have the right to feel devastated. There are solutions and magnificent opportunities out there. throughout our life, (meaning you and me), we, human beings have always been rewarded for the problems we solved and the opportunities we made possible for others.&nbsp;

Our compensations in good times or bad times are always been predicated (established) on the contribution and enrichment both financial and in terms of quality of life we could make to others. It is always so - and has been.&nbsp; There is no shame using adversity benevolently to create a newfound long term success for ourselves (meaning for you and me) and others.

Core Values are dynamic, what are our core values, ( mine: When trust is present things happen quickly and efficiently. When values are clear decision making becomes easy. I am faithful, steadfast and capable of bringing an increase in people's lives. That's what it's all about.).

How we can overcome?

In this type of situation, we need to Cut expenses.

Create new revenue sources. such as taking over retired agent's business, control their geographic farm no matter what they are or are not doing. My job still intact, I am working from home, prospecting, making appointments, encouraging and creating opportunities in the buyers, mind, and mine. My business still sustaining, educating, nurturing buyers and sellers' needs.

Believe me, I have been in many cycles, since 1983, evacuated from American Embassy in Beirut, civil war, left my country not knowing where I would end up, worked overseas (Korea and Japan with DOD, away from my tribe, they did not know my whereabouts, then Thank God I was planted in Fabulous Florida Keys, worked with local government for years and during life change and when another adversity hit me again the opportunity arose to pivot, recalibrate my talents and chose to "Be A Real Estate Consultant".

No Matter where you are, what situation you are in and going thru, my job is still intact and sustainable (at a limited level). In unpredictable times as I mentioned, with faith and diligence, I created predictable results. I am working from home, selling, listing, closing contracts, having conversations on zoom, skype, phone every media that I can reach my customers and clients. I have the ability to have meaningful, nurturing conversations with people, buyers, sellers, mentors, coaches who guide and impact me in many different aspects of life.&nbsp;

Again, Believe me, I have been in 4-5 transitions, cycles,&nbsp; and transcended&nbsp; (not One Like this COVID19),&nbsp; (911, 2007-2012, recession, hurricane Wilma Katrina, Irma), however, whatever and wherever it plays out,&nbsp; in my mindest, there will still be product services opportunity around us.&nbsp;

I want to become a force of clarity, a positive force, in the adverse environment people, are silently begging to be lead right now there are buyers, sellers, need our help, ethically, there are opportunities in adversity.&nbsp; Together, we will transition to a position, in a place of certainty and security and transitional prosperity. We will get you to a place where you literally have to live and love out loud.

This will end sometime, maybe weeks maybe months when it does there will be a whole new reality take place. Right now there is uncertainty, chaos, and ultra-dynamic mindset, like a broken tachometer.&nbsp;

Those that have the presence of MIND, Certainty (not in their knowledge exactly what's going to happen, but certainly in their Faith in themselves, believe in themselves, there will always be an opportunity to be made possible and problems need to solves and challenges needing to be resolved for others, will flourish, not overnight but won't be poverty-stricken. &nbsp;&nbsp;

I hope you believe in me, we can do this together and I will be there for you.&nbsp;

Linear minded agents won't last unfortunately they will fade. &nbsp;

I hope you believe in ME, we can do this together and I will be there for you.

God is Great all the time, I will finish with this, Peace and Much Love to you all\!

Hebrews 11:1 NIV. Now faith is being sure of what we hope for and certain of what we do not see ... And without faith, it is impossible to please God, because anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him.
