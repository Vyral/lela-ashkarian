My promise and heartfelt intentions: We can't go around it, over it, but we can go through it.

You need not be shaken or devastated—though you have the right to feel devastated. There are solutions and magnificent opportunities out there; humanity has always been rewarded for the problems we’ve solved and the opportunities we’ve made possible for others.

Our compensations in good times or bad times have always been predicated on our financial contributions and ability to improve others’ quality of life. This has always been the case. There is no shame using adversity benevolently to create newfound, long-term success for ourselves and others.

Core values are dynamic. What are your core values? Mine are as follows: When trust is present, things happen quickly and efficiently. When your values are clear, decision-making becomes easy. I am faithful, steadfast, and capable of bringing an increase in people's lives. That's what it's all about.

How can we overcome it?

In this type of situation, we need to cut expenses.

Create new revenue sources, such as taking over a retired agent's business, controlling their geographic farm no matter what they are doing. My job still intact, and I am now working from home, prospecting, making appointments, encouraging and creating opportunities in the buyers, mind, and mine. My business is still sustaining, educating, nurturing buyers' and sellers' needs.

Believe me, I have been through many cycles.&nbsp; In 1983, I evacuated from the American Embassy in Beirut amidst civil war in my home country. I left my country not knowing where I would end up. I worked overseas in Korea and Japan with the DOD and I was away from my tribe—they did not know my whereabouts. Then, Thank God, I was planted in the fabulous Florida Keys, where I worked with local government for years and. When more adversity hit me, the opportunity to pivot arose, so I recalibrated my talents and chose to be a real estate consultant.&nbsp;

No matter where you are, or what situation you're going through, my job is still intact and sustainable (at a limited level) and I can help you. In unpredictable times, as I mentioned, with faith and diligence, I created predictable results. I am working from home, selling, listing, closing contracts, having conversations on Zoom, Skype, phone, and every other media with which I can reach my customers and clients. I have the ability to have meaningful, nurturing conversations with not only buyers and sellers, but also mentors and coaches who guide and impact me in many different aspects of life.

Again, believe me, I have been in four to five different transitions cycles and transcended (though admittedly none quite like this COVID19). Throughout 9/11, the 2007-2012 recession, and Hurricanes Katrina, Wilma and Irma, I was able to persist with the mindset of perseverance and an understanding that there would be opportunities on the other side.&nbsp;

I want to become a force of clarity, a positive force, in an adverse environment. Buyers and sellers need our help, and there are ethical opportunities in adversity. Together, we will transition to a place of certainty and security and transitional prosperity.

This will end sometime. Maybe it lasts weeks, maybe months, but when it does end there will be a whole new reality taking place. Right now, there is uncertainty, chaos, and an ultra-dynamic mindset, like a broken tachometer.

Those that have the presence of mind, there is always certainty (not in their knowledge of exactly what's going to happen in the world, but certainly in their Faith and in themselves).&nbsp;&nbsp;

I hope you believe in me; we can do this together and I will be there for you.

Linear-minded agents won't last—unfortunately they will fade. Only dynamic agents will weather this storm.&nbsp;

God is great all the time—I will finish with this: Peace and much love to you all\!

Hebrews 11:1 NIV. "Now faith is being sure of what we hope for and certain of what we do not see ... And without faith, it is impossible to please God, because anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him."
